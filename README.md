# Machine Learning - Airline Delay competition

This Git repository contains the final notebook for my best score in Kaggle on [Data Workshop's](http://dataworkshop.eu/) [Airline Delay competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airline-delay).

In this competition I used categorization functions by [Sławomir Zagórski](https://github.com/SlawomirZagorski/MachineLearning) and adjusted them to fit my needs.
